## Repository

This repository contains two separate project:
* __3d-squash-the-creeps__: An isometric 3D game implemented by following the tutorial [Create Your First Complete 3D Game with Godot](https://youtu.be/YiE9tcoCfhE) by [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/);
* __my-3d-squash-the-creeps__: My own take on the game, where I try to build upon a good foundation and implement more advanced mechanics.
